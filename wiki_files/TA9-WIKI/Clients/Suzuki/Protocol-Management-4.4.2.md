Functionality Scope
=========================

The Protocol feature enables structured management of event protocols within the Situational Picture application, based on the event type. 

This functionality, available to system administrators, is built on two dedicated data models: one for managing protocol details and another for managing protocol steps. 
Administrators can add, edit, or delete protocol details, assign defined steps to each protocol, and attach supporting files to individual steps. 
Once the initial setup is complete, the defined protocol steps will appear in the Situational Picture application under the "Protocol" tab for each relevant event.

A protocol is composed of two layers:
- The first layer represents the “**Protocol Definition**” — the main configuration that includes protocol general details like crime type, protocol name and description and more. The protocol details screen can be accessed either from the “Apps” menu, or from the “Admin Tools” available for admin user.
- The second layer is the “**Protocol Steps**” which includes the individual steps associated with that protocol.

Linking between the definition and the steps is the Protocol ID, automatically generated by the system.

      
_Note: The protocol ID is automatically generated by the system and must not be entered manually._
      
_Note: Why should the “ID” field be left blank?_ 
_This field is configured with an auto-increment rule in the database, meaning that each new row is automatically assigned a unique ID upon creation. Manual input is not required._
      
_Note: To update an existing file, use this button to select and upload a new version._ 
_The previously attached file will be automatically replaced:_
