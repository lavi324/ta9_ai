**Functional Flow Diagram​**

•  The investigation process begins with the creation of a Research Request, where the analyst enters entity details and selects the investigation type.​

•  Once submitted, the system automatically triggers a workflow that collects relevant data from external sources (such as Lexis Nexis, D&B, and Hoovers) based on predefined logic and available identifiers.​

•  Two parallel identifier-based paths are initiated: the “Match ID” path connects to Lexis-related sources, and the “Research Request” identifier links to internal entity systems.​

•  The retrieved data is populated into internal data models and displayed in the centralized Report Summary Dashboard, which consolidates findings from multiple sources into a single unified view.​

•  From the Report Summary, users can proceed to the Lexis Summary Dashboard, and from there access additional dedicated dashboards for deeper analysis of data, relationships, and cross-referenced insights.​

•  Throughout the process, actions such as marking entities as verified, hiding irrelevant results and exporting selected insights are fully supported.​

•  This streamlined workflow improves accuracy, reduces manual effort, and accelerates the entity investigation process.

**Troubleshooting**

The Troubleshooting feature allows users to update an existing entity or insert an entity -> even after its workflow has been completed. without requiring a new request or altering the current investigation context.​

Once an existing entity is updated, the system intelligently detects the specific type of change and automatically re-triggers only the relevant portions of the workflow.  Based on predefined logic for fields. the system ensures that only the necessary data sources and down stream models are refreshed.​

Once a new entity is inserted, the system automatically triggers the full work flow, ensuring seamless onboarding of new data.​



✔ Time-saving – Only the relevant portions of the workflow are re-triggered​

✔ Accuracy & Flexibility – The system dynamically adapts based on the specific type of update​

✔ Seamless Continuity – Users can continue working within the same dashboard without restarting the process​

✔ Full Transparency – All changes are logged and tracked as part of the overall workflow​
