There is auto-escape for the following special chars:​

&& || ! ( ) { } [ ] ^ " ~ * ? : \ /​ + -
Auto-escape means that when the system detects these characters - the search will address them as a search syntax - meaning-affecting the search.

The other special characters are escaped manually!!​


Whenever a user wants to search for any of the special characters (that were not escaped automatically as described above) within the content, they should be preceded with a backslash \
