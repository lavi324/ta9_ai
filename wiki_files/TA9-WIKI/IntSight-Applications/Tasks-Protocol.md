### Intro
Task Protocol is a feature that lets you manage a group of tasks that has to be executed when something is happening.
### Example
Whenever a car accident is happening, we need to:
1. Close the road
1. Call an ambulance
1. Report to more forces around

So, I can create a 'Task Protocol', let's name it "Car  Accident protocol" and put some tasks inside it.

## Management
These protocols can be managed from within the Web (Admin tile) - created, deleted & updated. Each protocol's task can have a title, description, priority, active/not & a due-time - timespan representing the amount of time for the task to be completed.
### Protocol Link
A task protocol can be 'linked' to a lookup. For example, let's take the lookup "Crime Types". I can 'link' a lookup-value 'Robbery' (a Crime Type') to a protocol named 'Robbery Protocol' that I define in the system.

###Protocol Instantiation
A task-protocol can be instantiated to create actual tasks in the system. 
Currently, there's no usage for instantiating a task-protocol (to create actual tasks), but only manage them and display them.
