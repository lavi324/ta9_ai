If you try to compile and get an error like this:

<IMG  src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wR7mf.png"  alt="Unable to find the requested .Net Framework Data Provider in Oracle - Stack  Overflow"/>

You need to install "mysql-connector-net-8.0.23". It is located in:

\\10.100.102.13\share\Installs\New PC Installs\VisualStudio2017_Community

and install "mysql-connector-net-8.0.23.msi".

Maybe a restart will be needed.
