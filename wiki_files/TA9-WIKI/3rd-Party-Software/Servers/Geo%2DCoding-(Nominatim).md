#Introduction
Nominatim (from the Latin, 'by name') is a tool to search OSM data by name and address (geocoding) and to generate synthetic addresses of OSM points (reverse geocoding).

#Installation
http://nominatim.org/release-docs/latest/appendix/Install-on-Centos-7/

* You can download different maps to load from http://download.geofabrik.de/
* Please note - to install a large map like the whole world you'll need:
  * 64 GB ram
  * 8 CPU Cores
  * 1.5 Tera SSD storage
    not using SSDs will make the whole process really long, approximately a week.
