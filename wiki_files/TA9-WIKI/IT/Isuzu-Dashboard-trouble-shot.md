In Isuzu enviroment there is config file that manage dashboard dama models. It locates on C:\windows\system32\IsuzuConfiguration.json. 
If from any resons the dashboard stopped work (System.Exception: Connection to iq was unsuccessful) 
go to file and check if the file exists and check  if the "serverURL" configs write. 

After that make reset for Ta9 service and check if problem solved.
