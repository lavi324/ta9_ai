If you tried to open your CheckPoint VPN and you got the next error:

#The Solution
In our Share there is an exe file that is called: "EPPatcher_for_users", which is located in:
`\\10.100.102.13\Share\Installs\Utils`
Copy the file to your desktop and run it, before you run it make sure you saved all your files and open tasks because it will require a reboot.
